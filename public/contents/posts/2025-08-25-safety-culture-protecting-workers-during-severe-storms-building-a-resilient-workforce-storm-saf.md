That’s a critical topic—storm safety is about more than just weather alerts; it’s about fostering a mindset where every worker feels prepared and protected. Creating a robust safety culture around severe storms involves a blend of proactive planning, clear communication, and empowerment. 

Some key elements include:

- **Emergency Response Plans:** Ensure they’re tailored for severe weather, covering evacuation routes, shelter areas, and communication protocols.
- **Training & Drills:** Regularly practice storm procedures, so workers know exactly what to do, reducing panic and chaos.
- **Notification Systems:** Establish reliable channels—texts, alarms, PA systems—that alert everyone promptly and clearly.
- **Equipment & Facilities:** Make sure shelters are designated, stocked with essentials, and accessible. Protect critical infrastructure from storm damage.
- **Leadership & Accountability:** Leaders should model safety behaviors, regularly review plans, and foster an environment where workers can voice concerns or suggestions.
- **Mental & Emotional Support:** Storms can be stressful; offering reassurance and support helps maintain a resilient workforce.
