### 🏚️Structural Renovation & Restoration

<br/><br/>

Ladon doesn’t just repair structures—we restore confidence in every beam, wall, and wire.

---

## ✅Foundation Reinforcement & Wall Rebuilding  

Cracks and settlement aren’t just cosmetic—they signal structural fatigue.  

▹ Ladon addresses these issues with engineered reinforcements and rebar-backed rebuilds, ensuring long-term safety and stability.

---

## 🏠Roofing Panel Replacement & Deep Cleaning  

Weathered roofs compromise protection and curb appeal.  

▹ We replace damaged panels, seal leaks, and deep-clean surface layers to restore resilience and refresh visual integrity—especially in coastal or high-rain zones.

---

## 💡Electrical Re-installation & Plumbing Upgrades  

Outdated wiring and plumbing can become safety hazards.  

▹ Ladon modernizes infrastructure with seamless integration, protecting flow, form, and future scalability.

---

## 🎨Interior Retiling & Repainting  

Dull surfaces drain energy from otherwise vibrant spaces.  

▹ Our retiling and repainting breathe new life into interiors, balancing aesthetics with durability—ideal for both home rejuvenations and commercial rebranding.

> _Every renovation is a second chance to build better—from foundations to first impressions._
