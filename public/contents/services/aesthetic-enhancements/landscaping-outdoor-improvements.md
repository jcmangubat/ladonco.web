#### ðŸª¨Hardscaping & Pathway Design  
Function meets form in every step.

1. **Site Grading & Layout Planning** â€“ Assess slope, drainage, and traffic flow.
2. **Material Selection & Pattern Design** â€“ Choose pavers, stones, or concrete finishes.
3. **Excavation & Base Preparation** â€“ Dig, compact, and lay sub-base for stability.
4. **Installation & Sealing** â€“ Set materials, apply joint sand, and seal for longevity.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Soil Testing & Amendment** â€“ Check pH, drainage, and nutrient levels.
2. **Plant Selection & Layout Mapping** â€“ Match species to sun exposure and design goals.
3. **Bed Preparation & Mulching** â€“ Till soil, install edging, and apply mulch.
4. **Planting & Irrigation Setup** â€“ Position plants, install drip or sprinkler systems.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Lighting Plan & Fixture Selection** â€“ Identify focal points and choose warm or cool tones.
2. **Wiring & Power Source Setup** â€“ Route cables, install transformers, and test circuits.
3. **Seating Layout & Material Selection** â€“ Choose benches, tables, or built-ins based on use and weather resistance.
4. **Installation & Finishing Touches** â€“ Anchor fixtures, test lighting angles, and stage seating.
