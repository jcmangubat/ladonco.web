### 🏗️ Civil Infrastructure Development

<br/><br/>

Ladon doesn’t just build roads and pipes—it builds the invisible framework that keeps communities moving, safe, and future-ready.

#### 🚧 Roadworks & Access Pathways  
Smooth roads aren’t just about convenience—they’re about safety, accessibility, and economic flow.  

▹ Ladon designs and constructs access routes with engineered grading, reinforced sublayers, and traffic-calming features tailored to each site.  

▹ Ideal for residential subdivisions, commercial compounds, and institutional campuses where foot and vehicle traffic must coexist.

---

#### 🌊 Drainage & Flood Mitigation Systems  
In tropical zones, drainage isn’t optional—it’s survival.  

▹ Ladon installs high-capacity drainage networks, culverts, and retention basins to manage runoff and prevent flooding.  

▹ Systems are designed with climate resilience in mind, using slope analysis and water flow modeling to protect both property and public health.

---
#### 🔌 Utility Integration & Site Preparation  
Infrastructure must work in harmony—not chaos.  

▹ Ladon coordinates underground and above-ground utility lines (electrical, water, telecom) with precision trenching and phased installation.  

▹ Site prep includes grading, soil stabilization, and access planning to ensure minimal disruption and maximum readiness for vertical construction.
