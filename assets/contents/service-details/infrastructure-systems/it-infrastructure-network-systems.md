#### 🧵Structured Cabling & Server Room Setup  
Cluttered wiring leads to chaos.  

▹ Ladon deploys clean, modular cabling systems with labeled pathways, rack-mounted hardware, and airflow-conscious layouts—ensuring maintainability, scalability, and reduced downtime.  

▹ Server rooms are designed with future expansion in mind, including power redundancy, cooling systems, and secure access protocols.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Site Survey & Layout Planning** – Assess building layout, device locations, and future scalability needs.
2. **Cable Routing & Labeling** – Install trunk lines, patch panels, and structured cabling with clear labeling for maintenance ease.
3. **Rack Assembly & Equipment Mounting** – Secure switches, routers, and servers with airflow and power redundancy in mind.
4. **Testing & Certification** – Validate signal integrity, bandwidth capacity, and compliance with standards (e.g., TIA/EIA).

#### 📞PBAX, Paging & Alarm Systems  
Communication and safety must be seamless.  

▹ Ladon integrates PBAX (Private Branch Exchange), paging, and fire detection alarm systems (FDAS) tailored to each facility’s layout and operational needs.  

▹ Ideal for schools, clinics, and commercial buildings where real-time alerts and internal coordination are mission-critical.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Needs Assessment & Zoning** – Identify paging zones, alarm triggers, and call routing requirements.
2. **System Design & Hardware Selection** – Choose PBAX units, speakers, sensors, and control panels based on building specs.
3. **Installation & Integration** – Mount devices, wire connections, and sync with existing IT systems.
4. **Simulation & Safety Testing** – Run drills, verify paging clarity, and test alarm responsiveness across zones.

#### 🌐Network Design & Deployment  
Connectivity is no longer optional—it’s foundational.  

▹ Ladon designs secure, scalable networks from the ground up, including LAN/WAN architecture, wireless access points, and multi-site VPNs.  

▹ Systems are built with cybersecurity, bandwidth optimization, and remote work readiness in mind.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Topology Planning & IP Schema Design** – Define network layout, IP ranges, and segmentation for security and performance.
2. **Hardware Provisioning & Configuration** – Set up routers, switches, firewalls, and access points with VLANs and QoS rules.
3. **Security Layering & Access Control** – Implement firewalls, endpoint protection, and role-based access protocols.
4. **Monitoring & Maintenance Setup** – Deploy network monitoring tools, logging systems, and remote management dashboards.
