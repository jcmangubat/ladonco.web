## 🧰 Ladon’s Restoration Process

We treat every restoration as a partnership—guided by process, built on care, and shaped by trust.

### 🔍 1. Site Assessment & Damage Mapping  
Before any tool touches the site, we listen.  
▹ Ladon’s team conducts visual inspections, scans for hidden damage, and interviews clients to understand functional, emotional, and operational pain points.

### 🗂 2. Restoration Planning & Budgeting  
Transparency leads to trust.  
▹ We define scope with clarity, offer phased execution paths, and create budgeting options aligned with timeline, safety, and long-term value.

### 🛠 3. Execution with Minimal Disruption  
Your space, your rhythm.  
▹ Restoration workflows prioritize cleanliness, safety-first protocols, and respectful management—whether in homes, clinics, or heritage zones.

### 🔄 4. Post-Restoration Support  
Our work continues beyond completion.  
▹ We provide maintenance plans, warranty coverage, and clear documentation, so clients can move forward with confidence and peace of mind.

> _Repair is not a detour—it’s a commitment to continuity, legacy, and leadership._
