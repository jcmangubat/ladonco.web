### 🧑‍🔧Technical Systems Maintenance

<br/><br/>

Ladon’s Technical Systems Maintenance ensures that the invisible engines of every facility—electrical, digital, and safety systems—run smoothly, securely, and predictably. It’s not just about fixing what’s broken—it’s about preventing failure before it happens.

#### ⚡Electrical & Mechanical Diagnostics  
Power and motion must be predictable.  

▹ Ladon performs load testing, thermal imaging, and preventive servicing on panels, motors, and generators.  

▹ These diagnostics help detect overheating, imbalance, or wear before they cause outages or damage.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Asset Mapping & Load Profiling** – Identify all electrical components and their usage patterns.  
2. **Thermal Scanning & Vibration Analysis** – Use infrared and mechanical sensors to detect stress points.  
3. **Component Servicing & Replacement** – Clean contacts, tighten connections, and swap worn parts.  
4. **Performance Logging & Risk Reporting** – Document findings and recommend upgrades or usage adjustments.

#### 🖥️IT Systems Monitoring & Updates  
Digital downtime is costly.  

▹ Ladon monitors network health, performs firmware updates, and verifies backup integrity across server rooms and office setups.  

▹ Systems are optimized for speed, security, and remote work readiness.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Network Mapping & Device Inventory** – Document routers, switches, endpoints, and access points.  
2. **Firmware & Patch Management** – Schedule updates to prevent vulnerabilities and improve performance.  
3. **Backup Verification & Redundancy Checks** – Ensure data recovery systems are functional and compliant.  
4. **Monitoring Dashboard Setup** – Deploy tools for real-time alerts and usage analytics.

#### 🚨Safety System Testing (FDAS, Paging, PBAX)  
Emergency systems must work when it matters most.  

▹ Ladon conducts routine simulations, battery checks, and sensor calibrations to ensure fire detection, paging, and internal communication systems are fully operational.

**Procedure Highlights:**
1. **Zoning & Trigger Mapping** – Define alarm zones and test activation pathways.  
2. **Device Testing & Calibration** – Check sensors, speakers, and control panels for accuracy and responsiveness.  
3. **Battery & Power Source Checks** – Verify backup systems and replace aging batteries.  
4. **Simulation Drills & Documentation** – Run emergency scenarios and log performance for compliance.
